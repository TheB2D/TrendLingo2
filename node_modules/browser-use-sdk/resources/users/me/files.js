     * Get a presigned URL for uploading files that AI agents can use during tasks.
     *
     * This endpoint generates a secure, time-limited upload URL that allows you to
     * upload files directly to our storage system. These files can then be referenced
     * in AI agent tasks for the agent to work with.
     *
     * Supported use cases:
     *
     * - Uploading documents for data extraction tasks
     * - Providing reference materials for agents
     * - Sharing files that agents need to process
     * - Including images or PDFs for analysis
     *
     * The upload URL expires after 2 minutes for security. Files are automatically
     * organized by user ID and can be referenced in task creation using the returned
     * file name.
     *
     * Args:
     *
     * - request: File upload details including name, content type, and size
     *
     * Returns:
     *
     * - Presigned upload URL and form fields for direct file upload
     *
     * Raises:
     *
     * - 400: If the content type is unsupported
     * - 500: If the upload URL generation fails (should not happen)
