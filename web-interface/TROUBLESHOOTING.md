# Troubleshooting Agent Thoughts

## Step-by-Step Debugging

### Step 1: Check if Live Browser View is Showing
After sending a message like "go to ny times and search up chicken":

1. **Look for the "Show Live Browser" button** in the top right header
2. **Click it** if it's not already active (blue background)
3. The right panel should appear with the browser view

### Step 2: Check if Agent Thoughts Toggle is Available
In the live browser view header, look for:
- **Brain icon ðŸ§ ** next to the refresh and external link icons
- **Click the brain icon** to toggle agent thoughts on/off

### Step 3: Check Browser Console
Open browser dev tools (F12) and look for:
```
Session changed effect triggered
Current session: [object]
Latest task from effect: [object]
AgentThoughts received steps: [array]
```

### Step 4: Check Debug Panel
The yellow debug panel should show:
- Session ID
- Task count
- Steps count
- Raw step data in JSON

### Step 5: Manual Check
Try this exact sequence:
1. Type: "go to ny times and search up chicken"
2. Press Enter
3. Wait for "âœ… Browser automation started!" message
4. Click "View Live" button in the chat message
5. Look for brain icon ðŸ§  in the live browser header
6. Click the brain icon to show agent thoughts

## Common Issues

### Issue: No "Show Live Browser" button
**Solution**: The task might not have created a session. Check chat for error messages.

### Issue: Brain icon missing
**Solution**: The live browser view isn't loading properly. Check browser console for errors.

### Issue: Agent thoughts panel empty
**Solution**: Steps data isn't being received. Check the debug panel for session data.

### Issue: Nothing happening after clicking brain icon
**Solution**: The showAgentThoughts state might not be working. Check console logs.

## Debug Commands

Run these in browser console to check state:
```javascript
// Check if session exists
console.log('Current session:', window.sessionStorage.getItem('app-state'));

// Check Zustand store
console.log('Store state:', useAppStore.getState());
```
